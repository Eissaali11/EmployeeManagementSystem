You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Windows\System32

Before we get started, keep in mind:

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Please select an option: Use an existing project
? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: tesstapfir-31537 (tesstapfir)
i  Using project tesstapfir-31537 (tesstapfir)

=== Functions Setup
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript
? Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
+  Wrote functions/package.json
+  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.js
+  Wrote functions/index.js

? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes
